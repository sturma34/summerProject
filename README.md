# Object Detection and Image Classification
To use, first run MakePatchesWithCV.py to generate candidate patches from the training set.
  Then run BackgroundClass.py to create the background class. 
  Then Model7.py to generate the model that will be used to classify the images.
  Then Model7ConfusionMatrix.py to generate a confusion matrix with some of the training data to see how the model is performing on the different classes.
  Finally, run Inference.py to generate the results of inference on the test images.
